set3_original_rates: shift in horizonal and vertical directions (-8, -6, -4, -2, 0, 2, 4, 6, 8), that is 9 * 9 = 81 numbers,
                     original LBP, 8*8 regions, no overlap, uniform patterns, on image set 3;

set3_improved_rates: shift in horizonal and vertical diresctions,
                     improved with Sobel (Image gradient, 120 exponentiation), Gamma correction (0.15), and histogram equalization;

set3_Gau_para: use two dimensional Gaussion founction as the weight for each pixel (improve the algorithm on the original LBP),
               try to find the optimal sigma and overlap ratio, on image set 3.
               sigma: 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7
               overlap ratio: 0.05, 0.1, 0.15, 0.2, 0.25, 0.3, 0.35

set4_Gau_para: in order to find more reliable parameters, also test on image set 4 (seems set 4 has a better result);

set3_Gau_shift: test the performance when using Gaussian, shift in horizonal and vertical directions,
                horizonal: (-8, -6, -4, -2, 0, 2, 4, 6, 8)
                vertical: (-6, -4, -2, 0, 2, 4, 6)
                it seems the performance declines dramatically when shifting in vertical direction;
